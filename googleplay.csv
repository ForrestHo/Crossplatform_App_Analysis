I picked a location to pick up. I went to pay and. Nothing. ""Your payment did not go through, try another payment method."". I tried again, same problem. I deleted the card, re-entered it in case it was incorrect. Still would not go through. I though that perhaps that although the location I was ordering listed mobile payment as available, they do not accept my particular credit card at that location. So I tried to purchase a digital wallet credit through the app. This worked. I bought a $10 credit, no problems. So I re-order and choose Digital Wallet as the payment method. ""Your payment did not go through, try a different payment method."". I tried ordering through the web site, same error message. I checked my email, maybe I had forgotten to validate my email address. Nope, still won't work. At this point I'm BEYOND DONE. A few days later I happen to be by a Wendy's location so I go in store to at least try and use the digital wallet credit. In the end I was able to do so, though apparently this option is used so infrequently that no-one at the location except the manager knew how to actually use it. This app fails in the absolutely most basic level. If you can't actually complete an order it's useless and a waste of everyone's time, and all it does is expose users to potential for data breaches and privacy violations. After I used the one time code from the app I deleted my payment methods and uninstalled the app. When I described the problem to the manager of the Wendy's location, his response was ""Yeah, I gave up on the app a long time ago."".",1,0,,2021-03-23 18:01:45,,,Wendy's,8

However. It takes forever for the deal to load onto the app when I check it from the notification that tells me that there is a new deal. If there is a new deal why doesn't the app get it then tell me after. Or since it is a matter of a simple graphic why should it take so long. I am currently using my phone with 5g wifi and can download on my phone at 175meg/s. Yet 2 minutes later I am still watching the spinning circle loader.  Just tried to order through the app. I can't believe it doesn't have a pick up option when ordering. I hate waiting at KFC. Especially when it is busy. Ordering 5 minutes before I get there seemed like it would kill some of the wait. Not today I guess. Going somewhere else.,2,15,1.12.0,2017-05-19 10:28:55,,,KFC Canada,10

This app would work much better if there is some kind of barcode. I really hope the developer will be reading this review. My experience was that the kfc personnel was unable to figure out the code/barcode so the manager decided to give me a employee discount of 20% off. I really hope that the next update can solve my concern. Thanks!,2,0,1.7,2014-05-27 16:37:55,,,KFC Canada,10
