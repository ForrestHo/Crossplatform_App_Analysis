    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility can be a challenge for mobile applications. The services provided by the iPhone and the various Android phones may be very different. This makes it interesting to examine whether there are differences in sentiment between the top restaurant apps across iOS and Android platforms. In this project, we will adopt the method of scraping app reviews from both the app store which represent iOS and google play store which represent Android to perform rating and sentiment analysis to address the following questions:\n",
    "1. What are the overall ratings for those apps on these two platforms?\n",
    "2. Which apps have the largest rating gap across these two platforms?\n",
    "3. What are the sentiment keywords for both high and low ratings?\n",
    "\n",
    "Through analyzing reviews of the same restaurant app on different mobile phone systems, we can identify which restaurants have a big difference in ratings between the two platforms; then providing suggestions to help the restaurants understand 1) the reasons for the gap between rating scores on different platforms; 2) the factors (e.g customer service, waiting time, food quality, platform issue, etc) drag down the restaurant score which causes the gap between platforms, which should be improved; 3) whether they should continue to use the lower scored platform or not."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this review sentiment analysis we obtained two datasets by using two scraping packages. One dataset is iOS dataset. It is scraped from Apple App Store by using the package app_store_scraper (https://pypi.org/project/app-store-scraper/).  The second dataset is Android dataset. It is scraped from Google Play by using the package google_play_scraper (https://pypi.org/project/google-play-scraper/). These datasets both share title, review, rating, and date, attributes that can be extracted from the both datasets. Moreover, the both datasets are coded by review, company, and platform, so that we are able to analyze the review sentiment cross platfrom down to the company scope, not only focus on the analysis at the industrial, Food & Drinks, level. Therefore, we are able to do overall ratings comparison and review sentiment analysis between the two plantforms. We are also able to dig deeper, coming up with more insights at company level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions and Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Food & Drinks category, We exclude the companies, such as Uber Eats, Doordash, etc., who provide different services than the companies we pick. We are focusing on top 10 hottest apps, assuming they represent the whole category. The 10 apps are Tim Hortons, McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway, A&W, Domino's Canda, Burger King Canada, Wendy's, Dairy Queen, and KFC Canada. We planned to scrape 1000 most recent reviews for each app on each platform. However, Some apps don't have adequate reviews. Here we assume that all reviews have the same weighted of impact to our analysis at the industrial level. And we also assume that the date of each review is irrelevant.\n",

    "\n",
    "Normalization of the database resulted in a set of 4 tables, including tables for reviews, platform, restaurant, and replies. Reviews are the main table that contains the reviews, scores, and time of two datasets including iOS and Android. Using the platformID of the reviews table could associate with the platform table including the specific platform name. The resturantID of reviews table associated with the restaurant table includes the restaurant name and the overall popularity ranking under the food & drink category of each restaurant in Canada. Some users' reviews are replied by the developer which is associated with the devreply of the reviews table. Only the iOS dataset has the developer response and all information contained in one column, so we divide the reply content and time into two separate columns at first, and generate the replies table which contain these two columns and reply id."
