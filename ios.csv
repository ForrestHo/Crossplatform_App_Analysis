I am extremely frustrated with our 2 stores in dundas.  For example one store doesn‚Äôt open until 9. On Saturday, they weren‚Äôt open until 9:05 and at that point they weren‚Äôt ready for people.  They didn‚Äôt have coffee ready or baked things out. I believe they only had one staff member serving and she was quite curt with people who were waiting. I understand that she was stressed but she was in a position she should NOT have been in.  The manager did not have that store ready. By 9:15 over 5 people were in line with no one having been helped 

At both locations, service is not friendly, orders are often incorrect and at the drive through location I have waited up to 8 minutes IN the store without any acknowledgment or service.

Yeah, Tim‚Äôs hockey challenge is broken. 3 days now I‚Äôve made picks and then the following day it said I didn‚Äôt make any. Thanks for offering this still Tim‚Äôs, the gesture is still appreciated!

Update:
More bugs :/

First off, it was difficult even opening the Tim‚Äôs Hockey Challenge yesterday in the app. Then, when I got in, my picks were picked and registered but don‚Äôt show up today. That is, I take screenshots of my picks after it says ‚ÄúYour Picks Are Locked!‚Äù, just so it‚Äôs easier to see who my picks are during the games. Either way, none of my picks scores, but when I went to make picks today, it said I didn‚Äôt make any for yesterday?

To be more clear, I made picks yesterday, took a screenshot when the app said they‚Äôre picked, went on today and it said I didn‚Äôt make picks yesterday. Hopefully this‚Äôll be fixed soon though.

Original:
First, going into the app to activate offers is a little annoying... simply because you have to tap twice to activate ONE offer. That is, you tap ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù for the app to load the offer page, then ‚ÄúActivate‚Äù on this page to actually activate the offer... why not have you tap just once?

Better yet, why not just have an activate all offer?

Second, hockey‚Äôs back, so that means the Tim‚Äôs Hockey Challenge is also back. I noticed there‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like reminders for upcoming games and prizes I‚Äôve won.‚Äù, which was great because I always forgot about choosing my picks. But after a few days, I‚Äôve realized now I haven‚Äôt once gotten the notifications.

Weird, I thought I turned them on... okay, let‚Äôs just go check. >Enabled. Ah, okay then I must have turned off notifications in the Settings. Let‚Äôs go check that.... Wait, there‚Äôs no option for notifications in the settings app now for Tim Horton‚Äôs...

So if you go into your settings and scroll all the way to the bottom of the main page, you‚Äôll see a list of all your apps. There you can tap each one to change a number of things (location, Siri, notifications, etc). Every app (for the most part) has an option to change notification locations, sounds, badges, preview, and grouping. However, the Tim‚Äôs app doesn‚Äôt have this.

I suspect that whatever part of the programming that contains this batch of data is broken because there is no ability for us to change anything for the Tim‚Äôs app‚Äôs notifications (in other words, that‚Äôs likely why I‚Äôm not getting notifications).

I‚Äôm sure this‚Äôll get fixed in time though.

Additionally for months I‚Äôve been receiving and using bonus point offers. My favourite is use the app and get an additional 10 points. This week there was no offers at all for me.

False,Generally functional but somewhat lacking,,2,2020-12-29 05:22:22,SleepyChels,"I was excited to try this app and while it is functional in that you can buy Tim‚Äôs and collect points there are three key features that it is either lacking or has made it hard to figure out how to do:

1. If a person hasn‚Äôt added a credit card, it appears to be impossible to simply add a Tim‚Äôs card to the app. This is ridiculous and practically an invasion of privacy. Not everyone wants apps to have their credit card info even though they would love to use the app! And not everyone has credit cards. If there is a way to add a Tim‚Äôs card without having a credit card loaded, then they need to make the process a lot more obvious.

2. For heaven‚Äôs sake, link the Tim‚Äôs rewards with with the Tim‚Äôs card!! Starbucks does this. What  can‚Äôt Tim‚Äôs? We shouldn‚Äôt have to scan the app twice in this day and age. Probably I‚Äôm just a little peeved though because I learned today from someone working at Tim‚Äôs that we need to scan both the rewards and the Tim card screen - I have used this app a lot in the last few weeks and no one else told me that and I didn‚Äôt think to check if I was accumulating points. I missed out on a lot of points!

3. When using the app to buy a digital Tim‚Äôs card - please let the recipient print the gift certificate and use it! Not everyone uses the app! Or put in bold block letters that DIGITAL TIM CARDS CAN ONLY BE USED WITH THE APP. I was so excited to send someone a Tim‚Äôs card over email only to find out that they couldn‚Äôt even use it because they didn‚Äôt feel comfortable loading their credit card onto the app so that they could THEN load their digital Tim Card onto the app. I also called a Tim‚Äôs customer service line and complained about this.

It doesn‚Äôt like it when you change locations. Launching the app defaults to the last location you ordered from and when you go to change that location, your order disappears from your cart and notifies you that there‚Äôs zero items in your cart (but it‚Äôs actually still there because when you order your coffee again there‚Äôs 2 coffee in the cart.) 2. If you put items in your cart from home, then drive to your regular location, park, and try to submit your order, the little timbut runs forever and finally you get an error message. So ok, swipe up the app, reload your items and the little timbit goes running again and another error. So I swipe up again and try a few more times before it FINALLY submits properly.

And, look at all the rest of the unhappy reviews. Whoever gives a positive, must work for McDonald's. They never follow up to make it right when there's been a problem submitted 

The app is also a nightmare! Codes are glitchy,So if it doesn't work for the mandatory scanning, the  management refuses the coupon approval, so Huge waste. And Register=invasion of privacy+ The deals are crap too. 
Bring the old app back!!! It had better deals and no problems.Allowed to activate and then come to the store for proof, no connection glitches.Obviously McDonald's couldn't care less anymore.Even one of their managers told me -they don't care anymore because they're so big now, it doesn't matter if only some have legitimate complaints.

False,Still barely works,,2,2020-09-21 06:30:38,greatvovan,"A year ago I deleted the app because it worked badly. Today I decided to make an order before I drove to McDonalds and downloaded it again in a hope something has changed...

1. Log in. I entered my email and password... oops, it says, it is a new device (device is the same), and I need to confirm it from email. OMG, what a scam can be made on my McDonalds account? A bunch of BigMacs ordered? Okay, I clicked the link in the email, it opened Safari, asked to open the app, I confirmed, but... no more ‚Äúlog in‚Äù option in the app! Only ‚ÄúCreate account‚Äù! At the same time it shows that I am still not logged in. I tapped around randomly, terminated the app... after a minute I was able to get ‚Äúlog in‚Äù option back (don‚Äôt know how), AGAIN entered email and password, and finally it allowed me to proceed.

2. Order. Acceptable experience, but the UI fits badly on the screen of iPhone SE 2016. The orange panel where the app asks to add the item alone or make it a meal goes below the screen edge (only few millimeters visible). I had to guess what is shown there and aim my finger precisely, but was able to proceed. Finally I chose my items and store location, confirmed the payment option, and the app showed me the link to click when I‚Äôm at the store. I put my phone and sat in the car.

3. Pick-up. After a 30-minutes drive, I opened the app again and... it was empty! No active order, no ‚ÄúRecent Order‚Äù, no anything! At least logged in, thanks God. I had to collect order again standing curbside.

Why?
Because you listened to me.

I lobbied you to make it easier for me, the customer, to leave a tip whenever I use your app to make a purchase.
For awhile, I had to access my transaction history in order to edit my purchase.
Not anymore.
You've created a ""leave a tip"" feature that drops down from the top of my phone screen, once my bar code has been scanned and my purchase has been completed.
All I have to do is tap on the banner, and instantly I'm taken to the ""edit purchase"" screen, where I can add a tip to the purchase price.
As you know, your valiant baristas work hard and deserve the tips that I leave them.
Their expertise and personableness are much appreciated, always.
And now YOU have made it easier for me to express that appreciation.
So it's really true:  you DO listen to your customers.
Keep this up, and you're gonna give the food & beverage industry a good name.

False,"Good, but...",,4,2020-08-01 05:55:08,K U T Nana,"I like the app. Use it all the time... too much probably.  The local Baristas are starting to no my name.  I love that when I redeem stars that it goes to the most expensive drink. Thank you. That is greatly appreciated; many businesses do the opposite.  I do have a couple of ... umm ... Issues? Requests? Both?  

The issue I have that bothers me the most is finding a drink I love, but finding out it was considered ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù.  As winter faded into spring, my new ‚Äúgo to favourite‚Äù for both myself and my granddaughter, went from an already pricey drink at about $5 per, can now be modified from something similar, but is an expensive treat at over $7 a drink.  That‚Äôs a lot for a nice coffee. I am going to have to cut back a lot on coffee treats.  Once it‚Äôs on the menu, can‚Äôt you leave it on the menu even if you are not promoting it, especially if the ingredients are part of the stores‚Äô year round inventory?

One other request for the app specifically is a spot to modify instructions. For example, when I order in advance (which I do about 98% of the time), I cannot request a caramel wall for my younger grandchild. So, she either doesn‚Äôt get the drink the way she wants or I have to order at the store when the rest of my order is already complete. Defeats the purpose of the mobile order.

The app has been adding drinks to my order. Apparently they are featured drinks, but if you don‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs on there, you pay for it. Not cool. Plus, when it adds drinks, it will do it when I reload my card. Instead of placing the order like it use to, it shows me I have more drinks. The first time it happened, I inadvertently loaded my card 3 times because it didn‚Äôt take me to the place where it says my order was sent, but back to the review that lists my drinks with one , sometimes two, additional items.  Not cool.

Anyway, if you could fix those hiccups and add the one modification, then the app could be a 5!",Starbucks,3

False,Honestly Cheaper To Just Go In,,1,2020-05-17 12:49:28,Neimnmjaa,"This app has a nice layout, lots of information and it is easy to find what you are looking for. It is intuitive and has many helpful features. HOWEVER the only payment option through the app is Starbucks gift card loaded onto the app. If you have a gift card that is great unless the balance on the card is less than your order cost. While the app does let you reload the card, the minimum re-load amount is $10 and you cannot combine multiple gift cards to fulfil an order. 

So here‚Äôs my story: my order is $10.28, I had a gift card loaded that the app said had $7 left on it, and I had to reload an extra (minimum) $10 to cover the $0.28 of my order. THEN the gift card, instead of now having $17 just had $10 on it. I don‚Äôt know what happened, if the card actually had no money on it anymore and the app told me wrong or if my reload replaced the money on the card. Either way. now I STILL don‚Äôt have the $0.28 I need so I have to reload ANOTHER minimum $10. I was scared to have it replaced again so I reloaded $15 to a card that had a $0 balance. Just to do the math for you, I have now spent $25 on an order of $10.28 so that Starbucks can entire I spend all that money in their stores. Such a scam and a total money grab. I feel like I got tricked into spending more than I wanted to at Starbucks. The kicker is I probably would have ended up spending that much at Starbucks eventually anyways but now that I HAVE to I don‚Äôt wanna.

False,Love the app... but needs some fine tuning...,,2,2020-02-05 12:46:26,Sunshine_708,"So for the entire holiday season the app wouldn‚Äôt let me select egg nog in any drink. Even after verifying the store indeed did have it.  I called Starbucks twice and they were very nice but in the end nothing was fixed. The issue I have now is the app lets you select how many pumps of syrups or sauces you want. But when your order prints at the store it does not show the numbered amount of each selection. So your not getting what you ordered. I also have an issue when I order an iced caramel macchiato. I add caramel syrup to my drink and when I go to pick it up they omit the vanilla syrup stating they didn‚Äôt know if I wanted both. Yes I want both that‚Äôs why I ordered it. That‚Äôs what the recipe calls for. I also wish there was an option to add a smaller amount of money to the app. Like $5 or even $2 instead of $10. Sometimes I‚Äôm only a few bucks short and it sucks to have to pay another $10. 

Other than the problems above I love the app! It‚Äôs so much easier when I‚Äôm racing to work or the bus just to be able to run in and grab my drink and run back out. Especially if I haven‚Äôt eaten breakfast and my shift starts in 5 minutes. I‚Äôve more than once pounded back a slice of banana bread on the run.

False,Missing some options!,,3,2021-02-25 15:47:16,Niceguy169,"I got this when I was trapped in the hospital with an amputated foot, I was sorely missing being able to PICK my food, so I wanted to appease myself with some ""window shopping"" in this app. Only to discover I could never place an order with it! That was when I first wrote this review, June/July 2020.

About 8 months later, just got a forced update, NONE of these following issues have been addressed!

Firstly I ALWAYS order two cheeses, Swiss and the white cheddar. It'll only let me pick one! No matter what sub I construct! I can double the cheese, but only the SAME cheese!

Secondly, I always have my subs microwaved, there‚Äôs only grilled or panini press! I don't get to have a hot sub then? Excuse me, but this silly ""grilled"" thing is a comparatively new idea, for most of the time I've been going to Subway, the only way to have a hot sub was the microwave. I don't like the crispy HARD bread the other two options provide, I love the softness of the microwave. Where‚Äôs my microwave option?

Thirdly, one of my favourite subs is the Pizza Sub. Where is it? One of Subway's original, classic subs, no sub shop can exist without a Pizza or Pepperoni sub. It's the most basic sub recipe. Do I really have to take the Italian one and modify the hell out of it? (At least that includes the salami I like to add). All I see is a Pizza Melt, with nearly no ingredients and that ""Melt"" concerns me.

Fourth, since I can't place an order right now, it seems the least I can do is construct my favourite orders the way I like them and save that so I can order them quick once I can place orders again. But there's no ""Save"", anywhere! Obviously I want Favourites, but if I tap that I'm told I have none - obviously, as I'm new - but there's no Add Favourite button, just Start An Order. Okay? So, I start. I pick my sub, Customize it how I want and... nothing. No option to Add As Favourite. All I can do is add it to my order, no other buttons. On my order ""bill"" I look around, nothing. No Add As Favourite. I Google how to add Favourites, I discover a Reddit thread in the Subway Subreddit where someone asked this, his answer was that you had to PLACE the order (and pay for it), then the Heart icon appeared on your order. Really? ONE screen where we can add Favourites, and only after we actually order it? I TRIED maybe proceeding with the order, then Cancelling out of the Confirmation screen, but the Place Order button was disabled (I thought maybe because I needed to add a Payment Method or Delivery Address to my account, but exiting the order I added PayPal but logging in only brought me to my PayPal profile, and there's no option to enter my address). I'm blocked from the one thing I should be able to do!

Finally, this is only an iPhone app? No love for us iPad users with a larger screen and more powerful device? It‚Äôs ridiculous to see a Profile-orientation-only app which can't use the full screen and is formatted only for a more rectangular phone screen. Excuse me if I want to use my better device for this.

New additions: Firstly, I note that last time I missed mentioning, there's no notes on subs! Subway's gimmick is to customize your order according to you, no note to add customizations not covered? Say, for example, all of the above? There's a note for the whole order, but that wouldn't do the job well if there's multiple subs.

Secondly, since it seems NO Subway offers its own delivery, such the delivery doesn't seem supported in this app, I use SkipTheDishes - which unfortunately can't work with this app, since this DOES offer better options (like the full range of subs). I note that the drink selection is pathetic compared to when I visit, so I call Subway to address this and all of the above.

I was told these are the bottled drinks, it's the Fountain drinks which are interesting and they can't do what LITERALLY EVERYONE ELSE DOES and include Fountain drinks in a drink holder. Okay. So I came to this app to ""dry run"" a pickup order, the Fountain drink selection is just as pathetic! Worse! How unimpressive is it to offer the usual suspects and nothing more? And not even the whole set. Pepsi Real Sugar (is that just Pepsi?), Brisk Iced Tea, Brisk Lemonade, 7Up. That's it. Screw diabetics and dieters, no Diet Pepsi, no Diet 7Up. And Subway was the first place I've seen with the advanced soda fountains, tons of sodas with optional flavours like cherry or strawberry. EVERY Subway I've been to in the last decade has them. Where are THOSE options? (Pretty sure the reason is that they're too lazy to keep a list of what each location offers so they only list what ALL offer).",SUBWAY‚Ä™¬Æ‚Ä¨,4

False,"Useable, but frustrating",,1,2021-02-18 21:20:48,phloxe,"This app is useable but has so many annoying little glitches that I find myself frustrated every time I have to place an order. 

One, when they advertise the curb side pickup, you click it and it goes on to order. I go all the way through my order and ..... it‚Äôs not curb side. It says I have to run in and get it. Realize the second time around that I have to click this small button at the top of my order after it‚Äôs done to choose the curb side option. This should be a DEFAULT when rerouted from the curb side advertisement on the front page. 

The customization is a problem. Sometimes the sliders don‚Äôt appear and I can‚Äôt choose ‚Äúextra‚Äù or ‚Äúless‚Äù on certain toppings. Want extra cheese? Too bad! You can manually write it under ‚Äúother instructions‚Äù but unlikely they‚Äôll see it and since you weren‚Äôt charged the petty 50cents extra they probably won‚Äôt give it to you anyway. 

Reorder function is broken. I have to manually put in and customize my sub EVERY time. Reorder option leads to a never ending loading screen or just doesn‚Äôt respond altogether.

Favorites function is broken ‚Äúwant to favorite this order for next time? Click the heart!‚Äù But the heart is unresponsive and the order will not save. 

The app has potential and I‚Äôd rather order online than walk in during the pandemic but this app needs a LOT of work to be on par with other fast food services.

Pick up the subs, all of them have no cheese, I go back and ask the store to correct it but they refused.  I check the order on the app and the cheese has been removed.

‚Ä¢ The BMT (one of their best-selling sandwiches) is no longer available in the app at any store that I tried. That can‚Äôt be right. Must be a bug.

2. Where are the breakfast sandwiches in the app menu?  All I see are English muffin choices.  Checked under all sandwiches too.

3. Would be nice to have an option to pay with gift card and credit to use up that last balance, but I suppose you can just add more funds, but after the issues trying to unlock a frozen rewards account I‚Äôm reluctant to load any funds because the gift card gets frozen too!

4. I‚Äôve also been having trouble lately redeeming rewards online and instore lately which I‚Äôm sure is what led to my account being frozen.

5. Finally I had to figure out in my own that a frozen rewards account can be unlocked by submitting a gift card inquiry and waiting.  Despite my asking them to let me know why it was frozen and what else I can do the account was simply unlocked and I was never contacted to let me know it was reactivate or why it was deactivated.  A little follow up would nice and isn‚Äôt unreasonable IMHO.

Good luck hope this gets addressed soon.",SUBWAY‚Ä™¬Æ‚Ä¨,4

2018 - Causes more frustration than anything else.    Rewards scan unreliable.  Not sure if this is due to poor scanning hardware or poor staff training or both.  Paying with app is also unreliable.

September 2018 update...still doesn‚Äôt work.  I feel sorry for staff as the app must be as frustrating for them as it is for us customers.  I thought I could avoid the app by just using a physical rewards card but still need to use the app to redeem rewards.  The app failed two times in a row.  App shows a lack of real world testing before deployment.

February 2019 update...tried 2 days in a row.  Amazed after all this time the bugs in the app are still not worked out.  Still need to use physical reward cards to pay. App is useless for payments.  Kind of scared to use credit card with a company so technically incompetent.

The US version has since launch years ago.

Edit: Responding to developers response. 

‚ÄúWe are working with Apple to resolve this discrepancy.‚Äù This is an uninformed answer. If you referring to your app being listed as having Apple Wallet support and therefor you have submitted a ticket to have it removed, that would be the only condition in which your statement would hold true. 

Instead, it is a matter of taking the feedback you have received multiple times, and implementing the feature request. There is no discrepancy for you to work with Apple on. Your app does not have a feature ‚Äì lots of people have asked for a feature‚Ä¶ therefor you should seriously consider adding this feature. 

I‚Äôm sure someone on your marketing team said it‚Äôs a bad idea as we decrease our likelihood of displaying promotions to customers, or it decreases the chance that someone will place an order through the app ‚Äì but when you are not interested in using those features when trying to check-out at one of your restaurants and the application has inadvertently logged you out, so you quickly log in and then go to the page with the QR code‚Ä¶ only to be faced with a loading screen while it tries with all its might to display your QR code. 

The benefit of having Apple Wallet support is it is not tucked away behind a potential login error, and is saved locally to the device. Additionally for those paying with ApplePay, it‚Äôs in the same app as the customers method of payment. 

I am adjusting my app rating from 2 stars, to 1 stars as it appears you were unable to understand the feedback given. The rating will again be modified at which time the app is updated to support this feature request.",SUBWAY‚Ä™¬Æ‚Ä¨,4

Store hours are not consistently coordinated with the app allowing you to place orders with stores that are closed.  Automated replies confirming not only the order being accepted and ready for pickup, at a store that is closed leads you to believe you can pickup your order only to find the store closed upon arrival with no staff to assist.  

Also, no way to cancel or amend the order after you hit send. If you have a change or the store is closed then you must go through a whole bunch of bother to get a refund, if they will even give you one.  No huge deal on a single item but it‚Äôs a problem on a large order. 

Lastly, the whole menu is available to order from on the app in spite of many locations not carrying all items.   However, the system will accept and process payment for items that are unavailable meaning that the items you order have to be manually changed over the phone or on pickup.

The user interface is a confusing mess. When you submit an order, a countdown timer starts immediately, forcing you to race from wherever you are to the restaurant. 

You can only pay with credit card, so sorry to everyone trying to get out of dept. 

The wording is also super confusing. It shouldn't require a PhD in astrophysics just to customize a meal. 

The most frustrating part though is that unlike the McDonalds app which gives you multiple pickup options, this app requires you to go in to the restaurant, or curb side pickup. If you go through the drive through, the brains of the employees will implode as they have no way to confirm you are you. ‚ÄúAre you Steve?‚Äù Geez!

A&W did what they do. Took what should be an easy process and made it bloated and complicated. With the McDonalds app, I can sit at home and easily create a meal, pay and when I get close to to the store, I can easily pick up my meal in the drive-thru with a code.

For whatever reason I wasn‚Äôt able to do this online as it said system error so I went through the drive-through.

The gentleman at Appleby line at approximately 10:55 AM on Monday, January 18 said he had to charge me $1.99 for the free coffee as the drive up promotion had expired. I informed the staff member on the speaker when I was ordering the food and he said there was nothing he could do I then went to the window paid for the burger at which point in time he was arguing with me saying that the promotion was over and there‚Äôs nothing he could do. i said so I‚Äôm gonna go over to the parking lot there and order of coffee for free versus himjust handing me one.

He said that is correct so I pulled into the spot and waited for them to waste the time of another staff member to come out to hand me my free coffee.

Fast food has now become medium food at ANW I guess. I‚Äôm not sure who the marketing manager was to allow something to be free online but not at the drive-through.

Perhaps they were giving way too many coffees or they wanted more people to download the app.

My name is Terry Wong
I live in Stoufville Ontario Canada.
Currently my A&W App is showing a Beyond Meat Burger special at $3.99 each so
I made an APP order using my A&W mobile App for a Beyond Meat  Burger adding Cheese on the above date/time and I was charged a total price of $5.52 with tax.  It was charged to my credit card linked to the A&W APP and my digital receipt shows the above charge with authoriztion number.
The order number as shown on the receipt of my A&W app order is 45183-489-210111-1077498 and the restaurant name/ID is Stouffville.  When I arrived to pick up my order around 15 minutes later, I was told by the restaurant their information on the screen was that I only ordered a Cheddar cheese and the total they are showing on their screen is only $0.95.  As a result they cannot give me a Beyond Meat burger even I showed them my digital APP receipt on cell phone which clearly shows that I purchased a Beyond Meat Burger with Cheese and I was charged a total amount of $5.52 instead of only 95 cents.  I am not sure what happened why a mistake like this can happened.   I spent quite a bit of time in ordering and driving to pick up my food and have to spent quite a bit of time to talk to the store manager but eventually he said he could not help me because his screen is showing something quite different.  In order not to delay the other drive thru customers behind me, I have to reorder my Beyond Meat Burger with Cheese again at full price.  Meanwhile, I believe A&W have charged me $5.52 which I did not get anything so I am requesting this amount to be refund to my credit card.
I can send you copies of my digital receipt of $5.52 and the A&W Stouffville #4396 Receipt which the manage said he got only a Cheddar Cheese order from me but with no Beyond Meat burger.  Hope I can hear from you guys soon.
Regards

False,Racist or stupid pick up policy,,1,2020-05-01 05:15:30,Stephschum,"Back in October 2019 I was very pregnant (9 months along), I ordered pizza and had my boyfriend whom I live with pick up the order. Upon pick up they gave him the hardest time either maybe because he didn‚Äôt look like a white girl named Stephanie? They asked for his license plate number and drivers licence. We don‚Äôt understand why as they never even wrote it down? They almost refused to give him our pizza. He asked to speak to the supervisor and they refused to do so. He eventually showed him ID ... for a pizza with the correct pick up name. I was extremely upset over the issue and phoned the location to speak with the supervisor and asked who I was speaking to. The girl on the phone said her name was ‚ÄúTaco‚Äù and started laughing as she knew I must be phoning to complain. The customer service was terrible I reached all the way to the manager (his personal phone) who wasn‚Äôt there and also asked for the franchise owners information. We phoned another location to confirm if this is the policy and if they ask for customers licence plate and drivers info all the time. Supposedly it is stated somewhere in their policy but the customer is not aware of this policy. I highly recommend that if the option is pick up that they notify the customer after the order that they check ID upon pick up if you are not the initial customer that placed the order. I have never had this issue picking up my friends orders prior to this. Due to this issue I have stopped having Dominos pizza probably due to the fact their app doesn‚Äôt explain the pick up policy to customers.

the pizza was so over cooked and dry and literally zero sauce .. I felt like I was taking a bit of burnt construction paper;(

False,Payments buggy at times,,3,2020-08-10 19:41:58,ObviousBait,"Used it a few times just fine, but one time it didn‚Äôt work properly and it turned into a mess. Customer service response was far from ideal. Ordered through the app, entered card information and tried to load funds into the app. $10 two times. Both times was given an error after entering the security code on the back of the card saying the transaction failed and to please contact your bank. Didn‚Äôt think anything of it at the time and instead tried to pay for the meal alone rather than loading funds into the app. It processed the payment just fine that way. However, when I went and checked my bank statement it showed the two $10 charges were both taken out. Contacted bank and they said funds were gone to contact Wendy‚Äôs. I figured it might just be a pending charge and it would show back up after midnight or something. Contacted Wendy‚Äôs customer service and they said they saw the two charges showing as pending on their end and said it would likely show back up on the card after midnight as well like I thought. The next day came and I got 1 of the $10 charges back and not the other. Contacted Wendy‚Äôs again and was asked to send a screenshot showing the charge that was not returned back. Sent it with the case number in the subject line as they requested and never got any reply to that email. Contacted them again after a few days and then got into a huge scuffle with customer service again. Still missing 1 of the $10 and it‚Äôs been 8 days since the charge. It‚Äôs fine when it works but be warned of when it fails, you‚Äôll have an impossible time trying to get the missing money back.

Edit: The missing $10 never showed back up in bank account like the first charge did but eventually got a gift card for the missing $10 from Wendy‚Äôs. The only issue I have now with the app is the inability to pay part of an order with the gift card and the remainder with a credit card. From what I can tell it requires you to redeem and load the gift card into the app and then you can add more to the digital balance with a credit card, but you can‚Äôt just add the exact amount remaining for the order, it needs to be one of their given options. It would be a lot easier if you could pay with more than one payment option per order. So the pay once with CC after applying whatever digital balance you have in the app to the order.

Ok, but it can find the closest Wendy‚Äôs?  Sometimes. But so can every mobile map app and internet search engine without another waste of space app.

A group of immigrant farmworkers called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (or CIW) has been organizing to eradicate human rights abuses, like wage theft, sexual assault and in extreme cases, modern slavery which once ran rampant in the tomato industry, and improve working conditions and wages for people who pick the tomatoes we eat. They‚Äôve made incredible progress, but now Wendy‚Äôs is standing in their way.""

Most of the largest fast food chains, including McDonald‚Äôs, Subway, Burger King, and Taco Bell have all signed on to the CIW‚Äôs Fair Food Program. They have agreed to pay an extra penny per pound of tomatoes to raise wages and only buy from fields where workers‚Äô rights are respected. Wendy‚Äôs is lagging behind the rest of the industry and is refusing to sign the agreement, despite being asked five times since 2007.""

Farm workers and their allies are planning to march in the lead up to Wendy‚Äôs shareholder‚Äôs meeting in New York on May 18, and we want to make sure they can bring along a huge petition to show than consumers are behind them. Last year, the SumOfUs.org community helped push Trader Joe‚Äôs and Chipotle to join the Fair Food Program, so we know that big corporations listen when farmworkers and consumers stand together.""

The colonel clubs deals don‚Äôt work even at restaurants who have colonel club (as indicated on the KFC website). If you ask for the manager they might help you, but most regular cashiers have no idea what colonel club is and can‚Äôt help you. As for normal deals, the information on the app as to which restaurant has which deals is either outdated or simply wrong, so the only way to tell if they have a deal you want is to phone the specific restaurant. Finally, you need a postal code of a nearby residence to even access specific restaurants - there‚Äôs no other way to manually choose a restaurant. The postal codes for the restaurants themselves don‚Äôt work, and you‚Äôll get an error message. So you actually have to live near a specific restaurant to actually access its deals or order online function in the first place. 

The app is a complete disaster, and things will pop up and disappear, and you‚Äôll often get rerouted back to the horrible insert postal code screen.

1. The size of the text obscures field for entering information, choosing the order location, entering payment and selecting item for your order, 
2. It does not clearly show the entire delivery address. You can‚Äôt easily confirm if the address is correct or if the suite number is correct,
3. When try to set your location for pickup and delivery it is easy to change your location on the map. But it is hard to enter your location in the address box provided,
4. Selecting items for your order is awful, it is not clear if you have added an item to your order as you have to repeatedly tap the confirm but and then the add to order button.
5. If you create a KFC account the location, or  delivery information is actually saved between orders. I have to re-enter all the information each time I order.
6. Payment, if you are paying by credit card fields are hidden for entering the credit card information, it is not clear what field you are entering. The billing address is hard to enter within the credit card payment page.

False,This app is an embarrassment.,,1,2020-04-04 01:52:54,MutaleTowani,"There are so many areas that SHOULD be improved that make ordering using the app extremely frustrating.

When I refresh the screen, that information is no longer available and there‚Äôs no way of knowing how far along your order is. It doesn‚Äôt have to be intricate GPS tracking, even a simple one like Dominos offers would be great.
The deals are also very confusing. I have signed up for the VIP Colonel‚Äôs club and have never received coupon codes . So, every time I miss out on a deal because I need a coupon is frustrating.

The other part of the app is just a wrapper for the website, and even that, the app can't do well. The app uses old assets, and therefore everything appears huge.
